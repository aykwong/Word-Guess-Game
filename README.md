# Word-Guess-Game

This is a Pokemon themed hangman game. The user is to guess the random Pokemon that the computer chooses in the background and then pick the letters to successfully guess the Pokemon. Every letter will compare to see if it matches any of the characters in the word. If correct, it will fill in. If unsuccessful, one of the tries will be deducted. Also the keys will be recorded in the guess.
